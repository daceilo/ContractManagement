Bootstrap contains the basics for getting up and running. Will create admin and user users, both with "password" as password.

In dev environment, contracts, clauses and vendors will all be added for testing purposes.

grails-app/conf/resources contains word docx documents that are uploaded in the Dev environment (through bootstrap).

By default you should end up with:

* 2 users (admin and user)
* 2 roles
* 2 vendors
* 2 clauses
* 1 template
* 1 contract associated to one vendor with one clause and a template.
